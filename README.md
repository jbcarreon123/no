# no (World with stages)

no is my first Minecraft map.  
It is first shown as a broken map in Yahiamice's second map contest.
[See the VOD of the stream](https://youtu.be/Tty11zQjpg8)

## What to expect
no has 3 stages:
- First one is a item randomizer parkour.
  - Red is either magma block, soul sand, slime block, or blue ice.
  - Blue is just stone.
- Second one is a maze.
  - In the end, it says **YAHI** not **niYAHI**.
  - Now fixed the loop.
- Third one (and he didn't find the starting point of it) is a boss fight.
  - Because this is the **Wild Update**, you will fight with the **Warden**.
  - You will receive either a enchanted netherite axe, or a enchanted netherite sword.
  - And also given a Strength 20.
    - You can now 6 hit a warden.

Also, in the map, there is a fully working [Minecraft self-destruct ban (by Purplers)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv9cuItC_O8).

## Futures?
I'm in the process of learning more map making stuff.  
So if Yahi will run again a map contest, expect me to be there.
